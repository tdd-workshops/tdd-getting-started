2. Take a post-it and write down their learning goal and stick it on the Learning Goals board.
3. Think of which coding language they wish to participate in for the Coding Dojo.
4. Pick a post-it note of the color represented by the coding language and put their name on it. Stick it on the Attendees board (mahjong paper on the wall).
5. We will use this post-it notes to figure out how many people are going to do each language.

## Welcome Activity (10:00am-10:10am)

1. Find a partner, in 2 minute, take turns to share with them:
	- Your name
	- What's your goal

2. At the bell, find another partner and repeat the sharing.
3. I will ask for volunteers to share about their learning goals.

## Code Kata

### Exercise 1: Fizz Buzz

We would be attempting the [Fizz Buzz Kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/) on [Cyber-Dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org/).

1. From the [Cyber-Dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org/) home page, choose **"i'm on my own"**.
2. Click on **"create a new single exercise"**.
3. Select **"Fizz Buzz"** in the **"choose a problem"** selection box.
4. Click on **"next"**.
5. Select your assigned programming language and test-framework.
6. Click on **"next"**.
7. Start coding.

### Exercise 2: Login Form

Simple web app with a login form. The Kata is to introduce the participants to something more realistic - a new feature to the app (ie. implement password length validation). This will introduce the participants to the idea of **test driven development** and **code refactoring**.
