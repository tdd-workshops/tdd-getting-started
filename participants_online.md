# Participant Pre-Workshop Preparation (Online)

## Pre-Requisite

1. Make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

    - [Zoom Client](https://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting) (Please ensure you have at least version 5.3 or higher)

2. Please make sure you have an account with these services:
    - [Miro](https://miro.com/) for virtual sticky notes.
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/) for sharing source code.
    - [Gitpod.io](https://www.gitpod.io/) for remote collaboration.

## Collaboration Tools

We will have facilitators who can guide you in operating these tools on the day of the workshop. But it would be helpful if you familiarize yourself with these tools as well. 

1. We will be using Zoom's [remote control](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362673-Requesting-or-giving-remote-control) feature to work on code together.

2. For **remote coding** with the facilitators online, we will be using:

    - [Cyber-Dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org/)
    - [Gitpod.io](https://www.gitpod.io/)

3. For **doodling** and **drawing**, we will be using:

    - [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)

If in doubt, do contact the organizers via email.
