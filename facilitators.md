## Collaboration Tools

1. We will be using Zoom's [remote control](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362673-Requesting-or-giving-remote-control) feature to work on code together with the participants. Make sure you can grant access to the participants to your computer.

    - [Gitpod.io](https://www.gitpod.io/)
        - Install the Gitpod GitHub App (<https://github.com/apps/gitpod-io>) as well.

## Code Kata

### Round 1: Fizz Buzz

We would be attempting the [Fizz Buzz Kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/) on [Cyber-Dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org/).

1. From the [Cyber-Dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org/) home page, choose **"i'm on my own"**.
2. Click on **"create a new single exercise"**.
3. Select **"Fizz Buzz"** in the **"choose a problem"** selection box.
4. Click on **"next"**.
5. Select your assigned programming language and test-framework.
6. Clikc on **"next"**.
7. Start coding.

### Round 2: Login Form

Simple web app with a login form. The Kata is to introduce the participants to something more realistic - a new feature to the app (ie. implement password length validation). This will introduce the participants to the idea of **test driven development** and **code refactoring**.
